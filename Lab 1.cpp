/*  Homework Lab 1

Demonstrate char and string types used with output statements.

Use the cout object and insertion operator << to print different
character values and string values to the output window.

Use double quotes " and " to print a string value, and
use single quotes ' and ' to print a character value.

Example:

cout << "A string";
cout << 'A';

Insert the endl (end line) manipulator into the output statement
to start a new line or print a blank line.

Example:

cout << "A string" << endl;
cout << 'A' << endl;
cout << endl;

See the "Sample Program Output" at the bottom of the listing to see
what your program should produce when you run it.
